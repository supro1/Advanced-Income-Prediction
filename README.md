# Advanced-Income-Prediction
Income of individuals can be a key metric to predict the growth of an economy or the future prospects of businesses in a particular country or region and this information can be a driving force for new businesses as well as innovation and funding of existing and new business fields. So Incomes at individual levels can contribute significant information about the future development of businesses. In this project we are going to predict the income of individuals based on their career and basic personal details.
